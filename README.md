# -A-machine-learning-model-for-an-automobiles-dataset
I have made a simple project trying to combine some information I have learned from Kaggle courses, till the feature engineering course, starting with handling the missing values as a process related to the data cleaning then specifying some predictors and the preprocessing steps, for numerical and categorical columns, that have been bundled together with the model building process using Pipeline. Then I wanted to have more than one score from that model in order to see which step has improved the score well after introducing new features to the dataset like the "torque" and the "speed" of cars : It was the target encoding step or the cross-validation step or the two steps together and of course in comparison with the baseline score.
